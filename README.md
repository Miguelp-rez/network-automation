# Network automation

This repository is only used to keep track of all my scripts as I learn about network automation. The corresponding lab file and a picture of the topology are also available (in case you want to test my solution).  

To recreate any of these labs you need to create an account on Cisco's DevNet [website](https://developer.cisco.com/site/sandbox/).  

After that, go to the free CML [sandbox](http://bit.ly/freecml) and login with your previously created account.

Finally, make a reservation and follow the instructions to access the lab (you will need to install Cisco Anyconnect Client software).  

Once the sandbox is available to you, import whichever lab you want to try from this repository.

**Disclaimer:** All of these labs are based on David Bombal's *Python Network Programming For Network Engineers Python 3* udemy [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-network-programming-for-network-engineers-python-3/).
