# Network automation

This repository is only used to keep track of all my scripts as I learn about network automation. You can also find the corresponding lab file, where all tests were made, and a picture of the topology (in case you want to build it from scratch).  

To recreate any of these labs you need to create an account on Cisco DevNet, you can follow this link:  
<https://developer.cisco.com/site/sandbox/>  

After that, you should be able to access the free CML sandbox on the following link:  
<http://bit.ly/freecml>  

Login, using your previously created account and follow the instructions to make a reservation. Once the lab is available to you, import whichever lab you want to try from this repository.
