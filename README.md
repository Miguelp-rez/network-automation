# Network automation

This repository is only used to keep track of all my scripts as I learn about network automation. The corresponding lab file and a picture of the topology are also available (in case you want to test my solution).  

To recreate any of these labs you need to create an account on Cisco DevNet, you can follow this link:  
<https://developer.cisco.com/site/sandbox/>  

After that, you should be able to access the free CML sandbox on the following link:  
<http://bit.ly/freecml>  

Finally, you should login using your previously created account, and then follow the instructions to make a reservation. Once the lab is available to you, import whichever lab you want to try from this repository.
